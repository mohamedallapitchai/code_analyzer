# 🔍 AI-Powered Codebase Analyzer using GPT-5 + LangChain 

This is an **experimental tool** that uses **GPT-4** and **LangChain** to analyze a codebase — even when it has **no documentation, comments, or tests** — and infer its **purpose, functionality, and problem statement**.

Currently, this project is in a **primitive stage**, run manually via a Python script or an editor. It supports **any programming language** as long as the code is provided in text form.
